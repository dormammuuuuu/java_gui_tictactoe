# java_gui_tictactoe
This is a simple JAVA TIC-TAC-TOE game with GUI. The game has 3 rows and 3 columns. The rule is to make a three successive square grids of the same sign. It doesn't matter if it's horizontal, or even diagonal. They only need to have three consecutive squares filled with the same X or O symbol.

Note : this program might not run in an online compiler. I highly recommend that you use NetBeans 12 IDE.

How to use:
1. Create a new project
    - Java with Ant > Java Application
2. Delete the main file.
3. Create a new JFrame Form. (Class name= mainUIttt)
4. Replace the files in the project folder then compile and run.
